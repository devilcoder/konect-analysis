* The number of nodes in the Konect website is displayed
incorrectly if the networks are bipartite. For example, in

    http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/jester2

it says

    101,524 = 50,832 + 50,692 vertices (users + jokes)

But the number of jokes is 150 and the correct total number of vertices is
50,832. It seems that the total number is being used for the first
partition. This error is present in many bipartite networks. 

* dat/dep.statistic-attribute.diameff90:1:1: no rule to build konect-toolbox/m/konect_statistic_diameff90.m, needed by [dat/dep.statistic-attribute.diameff90]
* dat/dep.statistic-attribute.diameff50:1:1: no rule to build konect-toolbox/m/konect_statistic_diameff50.m, needed by [dat/dep.statistic-attribute.diameff50]

* Epinions

I tried also for the Epinions (ES) network, and I also get a different result.

For the 90-percentile effective diameter, instead of getting 5.26 edges as indicated (http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/soc-Epinions1), I get 3.9918.

As extra info, the hop distribution in the case of Epinions that I get with the function konect_hopdistr is:

   1.0e+09 * [0.0009    0.0737    1.0452    3.5683    5.1949    5.6443    5.7354    5.7527    5.7564    5.7572    5.7573 5.7573    5.7573    5.7573    5.7573]

the mean square of numbers is one.

* closeness and betweenness centralities as node distributions
* New directed Laplacians:  L_out = D_out - A ; L_in = D_in - A. 
** Eigenvalues should be nonnegative according to r. braun

(references are in [bipartivity]) 
* implement the statistic of [680] 
* gini vs jain:  although the scatter plots indicate that the measures
correlate negatively (which corresponds to their definition), their time
evolution has them both increasing.  In other words, "jain" should be

* extend ANTICONFLICT to signed graphs, giving a statistic similar to
CONFLICT, but that is normalized by network size, and thus can be used
to compare networks.  Check whether, in signed/rating networks that
change over time, the new measure grows or shrinks, validating or
invalidating balance theory.  Cf. [797]. 
* compute the moments (number of cycles of length R) empirically from medium-sized networks.  
* connected component distribution plot:  for each size N, the
probability that a randomly chosen connected component of a network has
size ≥ N.  On a log-log plot.   Should exhibit a power-law for small N,
and a big outlier for the connected component [PEGASUS: A Peta-Scale
Graph Mining System - Implementation and Observations].
* weight power law exponent as a new statistic
* statistic only for directed acyclid graphs:  length of the longest
path
* statistic:  Soffer-Vasquez clustering coefficient and transitivity
$\tilde C$ and $\tilde T$ [b845]. 
* oddcycles:  This is implemented wrongly for signed networks.  It
should be based on the unsigned adjacency matrix, not on the signed
one.  For instance wikisigned-k2 has a negative value of the statistic now, which
it should not have. 
* maxdegree:  at the moment does not into account multiple edges (except for POSITIVE networks in which they are aggregated), but should
* local sparsity plot:  for each integer k, the average fill of the
k-ego-network, where the k-ego-network of a node is defined as the
network consisting of that node and its neighbors at distance at most
k.   The first entry of the plot is the clustering coefficient; the last
entry is the fill of the total network.

* sg1:  make the *_adj arrays have length n+1, where the last entry
  always equals m, to simplify iteration over all edges.  
* sg1:  for SYM, have an additional variant where each edge is only
  saved once (will make programs such as hyperanf and matrix
  decompositions use half of memory).
