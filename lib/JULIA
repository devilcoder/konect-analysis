We're experimenting with replacing Matlab by Julia.

See jl/inter for an example script, and the @inter target in the Stu
file. 

We use PyPlot for plotting, which is based on Matplotlib. 


How to set up Julia
===================

* apt-get install julia
* apt-get install python-matplotlib

From within Julia (once, to perform system-wide setup):
* Pkg.add("PyPlot")
